# Twig Playground

A Twig playground that runs on [Deno](https://deno.land/), using [Twig.js](https://github.com/twigjs/twig.js/), with
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) integration.

You may find the Visual Studio Code
[HTML Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=george-alisson.html-preview-vscode) extension
helpful.

## Github Pages

Rendered output from `./docs` is published at https://jdocksey.github.io/twig-playground/ via Github Pages.

## To use:

- Execute `deno task start`
- Open `./output.html`

The output file will be updated as you make changes to the Twig and document templates, the template data, and the
Tailwind configuration.
